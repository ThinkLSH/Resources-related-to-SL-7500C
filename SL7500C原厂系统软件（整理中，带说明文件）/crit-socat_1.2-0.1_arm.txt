 socat is a relay for bidirectional data transfer between two independent data
 channels. Each of these data channels may be a file, pipe, device (serial line
 etc. or a pseudo terminal), a socket (UNIX, IP4, IP6 - raw, UDP, TCP), an
 SSL socket, a file descriptor (stdin etc.), the GNU line editor, a program, or
 an arbitrary combination of two of these. 
 These modes include generation of "listening" sockets, pipes and pseudo
 terminals.  If you don't know what this means you don't need it.
